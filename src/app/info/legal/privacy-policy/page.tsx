          <p className="mb-4">
            We retain personal information only as long as it's necessary for the purposes described in this notice, or if a longer retention period is required by law (e.g., tax or legal obligations).

          </p>

          <p>
            When no longer needed, we will either delete or anonymize your information. If deletion or anonymization isn't immediately possible (e.g., because it is stored in backup archives), we will securely store and isolate your information from further processing until deletion can occur.
